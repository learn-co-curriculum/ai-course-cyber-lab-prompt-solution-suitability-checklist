<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In the previous lesson, you learned about the Prompt Solutions Suitability checklist, and how you can use it to determine if a prompt engineering solution is suitable for your use case. In this lesson, you will work through the process yourself to determine the suitability of your project idea.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Lab Objectives</h4>
<p>By the end of this lab, you will be able to&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine a prompt solution for your use case</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="fragment-2" style="overflow: auto:;">
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>Steps to develop a procedure for your use case.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. Define Your Use Case:</h4>
<ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Clearly articulate the problem or task your prompt solution aims to solve.</li>
<li>Identify the specific requirements, constraints, and objectives of your use case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<details style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
<summary style="display: inline-block; background: #394a58; border: 1px solid #8A8B99; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; cursor: pointer;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"> Select for Example</span></summary>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">"My use case involves developing a chatbot for customer support to handle frequently asked questions and provide automated responses. The objective is to reduce response time and enhance customer satisfaction."</p>
</details>
<h4>2. Research Available Prompt Solutions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Would you need to conduct thorough research to identify existing prompt solutions relevant to your use case?</li>
<li>What kinds of open-source libraries, commercial offerings, or relevant research papers might be resources?</li>
<li>Consider the features, capabilities, and limitations of each solution.</li>
</ul>
<details style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
<summary style="display: inline-block; background: #394a58; border: 1px solid #8A8B99; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; cursor: pointer;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"> Select for Example</span></summary>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">"After conducting research, I found two open-source libraries and a commercial chatbot platform that could potentially fit my use case. One library has extensive documentation and positive user reviews, while the platform offers advanced features like natural language processing and sentiment analysis."</p>
</details>
<h4>3. Assess Model Performance</h4>
<ul>
<li>What kind of metrics would you use to evaluate performance?</li>
<li>How would you analyze benchmark results, documentation, or user reviews to gauge the effectiveness and reliability of the model?</li>
</ul>
<details style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
<summary style="display: inline-block; background: #394a58; border: 1px solid #8A8B99; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; cursor: pointer;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"> Select for Example</span></summary>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">"I could compare the performance metrics of the two libraries. For example, if Library A achieved a higher accuracy rate of 90% but had lower precision and recall scores and Library B, on the other hand, achieved an accuracy rate of 85% but had balanced precision and recall scores, I would know that I need to consider which metric is more crucial for my customer support use case."</p>
</details>
<h4>4. Consider Model Adaptability</h4>
<ul>
<li>Assess whether the prompt solution can be fine-tuned or customized to better align with your use case.</li>
<li>Determine if the model allows for incorporating domain-specific data or annotations to enhance its performance.</li>
</ul>
<details style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
<summary style="display: inline-block; background: #394a58; border: 1px solid #8A8B99; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; cursor: pointer;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"> Select for Example</span></summary>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">"Both libraries provide options for fine-tuning and customization. Library A allows me to incorporate additional training data to enhance its performance on specific FAQs related to my industry. Library B offers pre-trained models for customer support scenarios, which could save time in development."</p>
</details>
<h4>5. Evaluate Data Compatibility</h4>
<ul>
<li>Consider the compatibility of your data with the prompt solution.</li>
<li>Assess if the model requires specific data formats, sizes, or preprocessing steps.</li>
<li>Ensure that your data aligns with the requirements of the solution or can be modified to meet those requirements.</li>
</ul>
<details style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
<summary style="display: inline-block; background: #394a58; border: 1px solid #8A8B99; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; cursor: pointer;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"> Select for Example</span></summary>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">"The libraries have different data format requirements. Library A requires data to be in a specific JSON format, while Library B accepts plain text. I will need to convert my existing FAQs into the appropriate format for the chosen library."</p>
</details>
<h4>6. Review Ethical Considerations</h4>
<ul>
<li>How would you examine the ethical implications associated with your prompt solution?</li>
<li>Consider factors like privacy, bias, and fairness.</li>
<li>Evaluate whether the solution aligns with your ethical standards and has been evaluated for potential biases or unintended consequences.</li>
</ul>
<details style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
<summary style="display: inline-block; background: #394a58; border: 1px solid #8A8B99; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; cursor: pointer;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"> Select for Example</span></summary>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">"Ensuring fairness and avoiding biases are important to me. I need to carefully evaluate both the libraries and the data for potential biases in responses based on gender, race, or any other sensitive attributes. I will also look for any documentation on how the libraries handle user data privacy."</p>
</details>
<h4>7. Test and Validate</h4>
<ul>
<li>How would you perform a test implementation of your prompt solution on a representative sample of your use case?</li>
<li>How would you evaluate its performance in a controlled environment, measure its accuracy, and assess if it meets your expectations and requirements?</li>
<li>How would you validate the results against ground truth or expert evaluation?</li>
</ul>
<details style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
<summary style="display: inline-block; background: #394a58; border: 1px solid #8A8B99; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; cursor: pointer;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"> Select for Example</span></summary>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">"I will implement both libraries with a sample set of customer queries and evaluate their responses. I'll compare the accuracy of the chatbot's answers against expert evaluation and gather feedback from users to ensure the chosen solution meets their needs."</p>
</details>
<h4>8. Consider Scalability and Cost</h4>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate the scalability and cost implications of your prompt solution.</li>
<li>Assess whether it can handle the increasing workload or data volumes without compromising performance or incurring excessive costs.</li>
<li>Consider factors like deployment requirements, computational resources, and licensing fees.</li>
</ul>
<details style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
<summary style="display: inline-block; background: #394a58; border: 1px solid #8A8B99; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; cursor: pointer;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"> Select for Example</span></summary>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">"I need to assess the scalability and cost implications of the libraries. Library A requires more computational resources but offers a free open-source license, while Library B has a subscription-based pricing model but provides scalable cloud infrastructure. I'll need to weigh the pros and cons based on my budget and anticipated user demand."</p>
